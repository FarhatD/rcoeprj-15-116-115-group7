# Endangered Fish Species Indentification System

> **Abstract** : The system helps to identify the fish species that are endangered in the Indian Ocean. It helps to educate the fishermen by providing with all the essential details that might be required to give all information like their scientific name, local name, their habitat, their feeding habits, common appearance and their most common location where they can be found related to the image of the fish that has been uploaded by the users. According to the dataset that we are going to create from scratch specifically for Indian Ocean fishes, the user will get the information about the bulk appearance of a certain fish. The dataset will comprise of images of the fishes from the Indian Ocean and their related information that has been Mentioned above. The dataset will be trained with the help of CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and pattern recognition using the features like color, shape of the fins and tail of the fish. Thus measures can be taken accordingly to preserve these endangered species from getting extinct. Furthermore we could try and  alert the user about the area of the endangered species based of their location.
